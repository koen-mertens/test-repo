Here's a step-by-step plan to help you transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git, along with exercises to reinforce your learning.

### **Phase 1: Basics of Git**

#### 1. **Understand the Differences Between Git and SVN**
   - Git is decentralized, while SVN is centralized.
   - Git uses snapshots of the project’s file system, whereas SVN tracks changes at the file level.
   - In Git, branching is lightweight and encouraged, whereas in SVN, it is more heavyweight.

   **Exercise:**
   - Write down the key differences between Git and SVN in your own words.
   - Try visualizing the workflows (SVN's central server vs. Git's local repository and remote).

#### 2. **Install Git and Set Up a Repository**
   - Install Git on your machine: [Git installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   - Set up your user name and email in Git:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

   **Exercise:**
   - Create a local Git repository:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-git-project
     cd my-git-project
     git init
     ```
   - Add a simple file (e.g., README.md), stage, and commit it:
     ```bash
     echo "# My Git Project" >> README.md
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

#### 3. **Learning the Workflow**
   - **Staging area**: Git uses a staging area to organize commits.
   - **Committing**: Saving snapshots of your project.
   - **Basic Commands**:
     - `git add`
     - `git commit`
     - `git status`
     - `git log`

   **Exercise:**
   - Modify the README file, add the changes, and commit again.
   - Use `git log` to view your commit history.

### **Phase 2: Branching, Merging, and Remote Repositories**

#### 4. **Branches in Git**
   - Git's branching model is flexible and easy to use.
   - Create, switch, and merge branches frequently to manage different features.

   **Exercise:**
   - Create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b new-feature
     ```
   - Make changes to a file, commit them, and switch back to the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge new-feature
     ```

#### 5. **Remote Repositories (GitHub/GitLab)**
   - Learn how to interact with remote repositories.
   - **Push** your changes to a remote repository and **pull** updates from others.
   - `git push` and `git pull` are the core commands.

   **Exercise:**
   - Create a GitHub/GitLab account if you don’t have one.
   - Create a remote repository and push your local project to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```

#### 6. **Merging and Conflict Resolution**
   - Learn how to handle merge conflicts when working with multiple branches or collaborators.
   - Practice resolving conflicts manually.

   **Exercise:**
   - Create two branches, make conflicting changes to the same file in both, and try to merge them:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b branch1
     # Make changes and commit
     git checkout -b branch2
     # Make conflicting changes and commit
     git checkout main
     git merge branch1
     git merge branch2  # This will create a conflict
     ```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Git**

#### 7. **Rebasing**
   - Understand the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.
   - Rebase can simplify your commit history but may require more care when working with others.

   **Exercise:**
   - Create a branch, make some commits, then rebase it onto the main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     # Make commits
     git checkout main
     git rebase main feature-branch
     ```

#### 8. **Git Stash**
   - Learn how to save your work temporarily using `git stash`, useful when you need to switch branches quickly.

   **Exercise:**
   - Modify a file without committing, then stash the changes:
     ```bash
     git stash
     git stash pop  # To apply stashed changes
     ```

#### 9. **Interactive Rebase and Squashing Commits**
   - Use interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) to clean up your commit history by squashing multiple commits into one.

   **Exercise:**
   - Make several commits, then use `git rebase -i` to squash them into a single commit.

#### 10. **Contributing to Open Source Projects**
   - Learn how to fork a repository, clone it locally, make contributions via pull requests, and stay up to date with the upstream repository.

   **Exercise:**
   - Fork a simple open-source project on GitHub.
   - Clone it locally, make a small change, and create a pull request.

### **Phase 4: Git Best Practices**

#### 11. **Git Workflows**
   - Learn about popular Git workflows:
     - GitFlow
     - GitHub Flow
     - Forking Workflow

   **Exercise:**
   - Read about Git workflows and experiment with one that fits your style.

#### 12. **Collaborative Work**
   - Practice working with multiple collaborators, resolving conflicts, and creating pull requests.

   **Exercise:**
   - Pair with a colleague, clone the same project, and work on different features, then merge and resolve conflicts together.
